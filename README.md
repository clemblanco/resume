# Hey, I'm Clem ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer, producing efficient applications using best practices and technologies which empower teams. I strive for maintainable products, efficient codebases, simplicity and well organised teams where standards, tools, and processes facilitate the development to deployment journey.

Naturally curious and mission driven, I work to maintain a broad range of skills, while keeping open source close to my heart. Ultimately, I enjoy producing beautiful, clean, solid and meaningful products as a team.

# Hey, I'm Clem ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate software developer who loves solving problems. I strive for maintainable user-centric products, clean and efficient codebases, and high-performing teams where standards, tools, and processes smooth the development to deployment journey.

Naturally curious, I work to maintain a broad range of skills, from architecture to web and mobile tech, to DevOps, to team development. I'm a big fan of Laravel, praise open source and contribute when possible. Ultimately, I enjoy producing solid, meaningful products.

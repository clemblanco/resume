# Hey, I'm Clem ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate software developer producing efficient applications for web and mobile, using best practices and innovative technologies.

I strive for maintainable products, clean and efficient codebases, and well organised teams where standards, tools, and processes smooth the development to deployment journey.

Naturally curious, I work to maintain a broad range of skills, from web and mobile tech, to DevOps, to team development.

Ultimately, I enjoy producing beautiful, clean, solid and meaningful products.
